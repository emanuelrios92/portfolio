            <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__texto">I am an Argentinian currently living in Brazil, bringing with me a wealth of experience in the Onboarding-Support Specialist domain. My proficiency extends to front-end development, where I am adept in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I am embarking on my journey into back-end technologies like NodeJS and Python. Native Spanish and advanced in both English and Portuguese, I am deeply committed to expanding my horizons in IT and continually advancing my career. Currently studying Cybersecurity, as I find this world very interesting and crucial nowadays.</p>
            <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__texto">I love traveling, discovering new horizons, and cultures as I believe this enriches the soul. Being a digital nomad helps me align my passions with my profession, and meeting other digital nomads as well as entrepreneurs motivates me and boosts my creativity. Feel free to reach out to me, even if it's just to chat about our experiences. What do you think?
